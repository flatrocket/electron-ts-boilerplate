# Electron TypeScript Boilerplate

This simple project just gives you a clean start for the development of an Electron based application with AngularJS.


## Dependencies

This project uses:

- Electron (platform)
- AngularJS (frontend framework)
- Browserify (bundling)

Before running, be sure to download the required dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```


## Build

Once installed all dependencies, you can build the project with [VisualStudio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), using the shortcut **CTRL + SHIFT + B**.


## Run

Now you can run the app

```bash
npm start
```

directly from the integrated terminal in VisualStudio Code or from a separated terminal window.


## Development

All the development must be done inside the **./src** folder.
When compiling, all necessary files will be compiled, bundled and/or copied to the **./app** folder.
The project has been started using VisualStudio Code (as you can see by the folder **.vscode** in the repo), but whatever IDE can be used to develop starting from this boilerplate project.
